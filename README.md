# RISC-V-Pipeline-Implementation-verilog
RISC-V RV32I 5-stage pipelined CPU built for a Computer Architecture course. Includes a Python assembler, complete Verilog datapath modules, pipeline integration, and simulation testbenches using Icarus Verilog.

📌 Project Description
This repository contains of our RISC-V RV32I processor implementation.
In this phase we built:

A custom Python RISC-V assembler
All required Verilog hardware modules
A working 5-stage pipelined CPU
Dedicated testbenches for every module
They exist only to execute the simulation
✔️ .vcd files (waveform dumps)
Generated while running the .vvp simulation

Contain timing diagrams and signal transitions

Used for visual debugging of the CPU pipeline via GTKWave

View using:

Complete simulation waveforms (.vcd files)

A full PDF report describing the design

This CPU currently doesnot include hazards or forwarding (implemented in Phase 2).

🛠️ Tools & Simulation Environment
This project uses Icarus Verilog as the primary Verilog compiler and simulator.

Icarus Toolchain
iverilog → Compiles Verilog files into a simulation executable (.vvp)
vvp → Runs the compiled simulation
gtkwave → Used to open waveform files (.vcd)
We selected Icarus Verilog because it is fast, open-source, and ideal for CPU design projects.

📡 Understanding .vcd and .vvp Files
During simulation, the following files are generated automatically:

✔️ .vvp files (compiled simulation executables)
Produced by the Icarus compiler (iverilog)
Contain the compiled logic of the testbench + modules
